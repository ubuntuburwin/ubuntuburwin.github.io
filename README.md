Teaching basic web-dev with Flask, HTML, CSS and Javascript

## Getting started

### Download things!
<br />
Git (Version Control, allows you to communicate with a database to store code): https://git-scm.com/downloads <br />
Python (Programming Language, we're gonna be working in 3.7): https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-377/ <br />
IDE (This is where fancy things happen, making your life easier. You get a choice! See below) <br />

### IDEs
All I got off the top of my head but there is many more! If you're indecisive go with Pycharm (Community if you don't want to get the liscence)
* Pycharm (Option 1) I like this best personally, honestly so good. May be a bit clunky for you though (https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/)
* Eclipse (Option 2) This is what ICS 33 runs on. Honestly not a bad IDE just feels a bit outdated (probably because I used to use a similar IDE in High School) not a bad option (https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)
* Spyder (Option 3) Henry's preferred IDE! I don't know much but -- it is available! (https://docs.spyder-ide.org/installation.html)
* Notepad (Option 4) Nothing to it -- Python can be programmed as if it was a TXT document. It is a wee bit of a nightmare though, but it can be done, and some people really stand by it because no matter what machine, you can do it! (Already built in)

### Basic concepts

Web development! HTML, CSS and JS -- I guess this works: https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/ or..https://www.codecademy.com/. <br /> 
Honestly, for web development we will probably try to learn by doing. Anywhoo fingers crossed this goes well~

Afterwards.. well we will burn that bridge when we get there!
